## Fake News Detection on Twitter using DistilBERT
This project uses the distilbert-base-uncased model from Hugging Face Transformers to classify political tweets as real or fake with high accuracy (98%). 
It includes:

Preprocessing of noisy tweet data (removing links, mentions).
Label encoding and data cleaning.
Fine-tuning of a DistilBERT model for binary classification.
Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
Visualization of training loss and predictions.
