### Features

- Preprocessing of noisy tweet data (removing links, mentions, special characters)  
- Label encoding and data cleaning  
- Fine-tuning of a **DistilBERT** model for binary classification  
- Evaluation using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score
  - Confusion matrix  
- Visualization of:
  - Training loss  
  - Prediction results
